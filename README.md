# Project goals

Main goals of this project:
- Implement a basic working version of roborally.
- Implementation styles: Object orientated programming and Test driven development.
- CI/CD: run your tests automatically when pushing code to Gitlab.
- Used languages and frameworks: Springboot, React, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, Java, Gradle & MySQL. 


## Project planning

See project board in Gitlap: https://git.sogyo.nl/erikhof/roborally/-/boards.


## Repository structure

- Main folder (this folder): contains the files relevant for the whole project. For example the Gradle-wrapper files, the .gitignore, and this readme.
- api/: contains the files for the API or service layer of your application.
- api/src/main/java/mancala/api: contains the web endpoints.
- api/src/main/java/mancala/api/models: contains the web endpoints.
- domain/: contains the files that model the business domain (game rules). This is the folder you develop your OO mancala case in.
- client/: contains the client (front-end)


## Two servers

The project consists of two servers. The front-end uses a Node.js server. It is mainly used to compile your React code into Javascript files during development. This will shorten the feedback loop between changing your code and seeing the results in the browser. The second server is the back-end, which uses a Jetty server. The back-end server allows your Java API to be accessible for other programs, including the front-end server. To prevent [cross-origin request shenanigans (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), all requests from the browser will be sent to the front-end server. That server will then forward to the back-end server if needed.

The front-end assumes that the back-end will run on port 8080. If that is not the case, edit the webpack.config.js file.

To run the application you need to have both servers running at the same time. This probably means you'll need to open two different terminals/command prompts to do so.


## React project structure

A React project is generally structured as follows:

```
package.json
public/
   index.html
src/
   Feature1/
      Feature1.css
      Feature1.tsx
      Feature1.tests.tsx
   Feature2/
      Feature2.css
      Feature2.tsx
      Feature2.tests.tsx
      Feature2B.tsx
      Feature2B.tests.tsx
```

The public directory contains static files, such as the relatively empty index.html file needed to run React. The src file contains the React code. The convention for TypeScript projects is to use the .tsx file extension for files that contain React components. Files are generally grouped together in directories by feature. These directories contain all files related to that feature, such as coponents, stylesheets, images and tests.


## Installing front-end dependencies

To run the React application you'll first need to install the required dependencies. These dependencies are defined in the package.json file. Run the command `npm install` from the `/client` directory.


## Running the front-end

The package.json specifies which commands can be run using npm (e.g. npm run start). In this sample repository, two commands have been defined. You should also run these in the `/client` directory.

```bash
# Start a development server
npm run start
# Check code for common mistakes and style conventions
npm run lint
```


## Java project structure

A Java project is generally structured as follows:

```
build.gradle
src/
   main/
       (package)/
            (Java files)
   test/
       (package)/
            (Java test files)
```

In the project root folder (for example, the domain/ folder), a project definition is found. As we use Gradle, we have a build.gradle file.  This file contain roughly the same: the project metadata and its dependencies. The build tool can then resolve those dependencies by downloading them from an online registry or compile related projects and link the resulting jar files.

A build tool also makes sure multiple Java files inside the same project are compiled in one go. Basically it acts as a wrapper around the compiler. You can invoke the compiler manually by typing `javac roborally/domain/Foo.java roborally/domain/Bar.java` over and over, or let your build tool generate and execute the command for you.

To tell the build tool which files to compile, the above structure is used. In src/main/ you place your application code, the actual implementation of the game rules. You should also adhere to the Java file structure, meaning that your folder structure should match your package definition (roborally/domain/) and your filename should match your class name (Foo.java). In src/test/ you place the files that test your main code. By convention, the test file structure mimics the main file structure (roborally/domain/FooTest.java).


## Using Gradle

You can either install Gradle on your machine and use the installation or use the Gradle wrapper files found next to this README. Replace the `./gradlew` command with `gradle` if using the globally installed Gradle or `.\gradlew.bat` if you're running the Windows batch script.

```bash
# Building
./gradlew build
# Testing (will fail with the initial code)
./gradlew test
# Running (only relevant for the MVC case)
./gradlew run
```

If you run the build tool with either the `build` or `test` options, you will see that the tests in the `api/src/test/.../StartRoborallyTest.java` file fail. Check the test output and see if you can figure out why these tests fail.

The tests fail because we have no domain classes implemented yet.

In our `StartRoborally` servlet, we instantiate our domain as `null` on line 22. Instead, we should instantiate a class here that implements the `Playable` interface. You can do so by merging the mainline branch (where you first wrote your mancala game) into this branch and implementing a `RoborallyGame.java` class that uses the methods from your classes to adhere to the `Playable` interface. 

If you do so correctly, these tests should succeed, and the back-end should build successfully.

If you run the program, you will notice the build "progress" is stuck on 87% or so. That means your application is running and Gradle is waiting for it to succeed. You can ignore the progress bar when running the application; it should print some lines when it's ready.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
